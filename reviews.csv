"RRNW8O8WKON3S","Tabby Katt","Kids hats no longer fit, so we were searching for a new winter hat. This one is great quality, fits perfectly, and we LOVE the color! It's just as pictured, and luckily matches the new winter jacket we got him! At first I thought the cost seemed a bit much, because it is name brand, but I wanted to splurge a little. After receiving the item I can say it is worth it. It's well made, warm, and it seems like it was made to last. One of the best quality hats I've come across yet! I'm happy with my purchase :)","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022","Little brother loves it!",5,"","3","One Size","Cadmium Green/Shadow Marl"
"R2H354V80I4Z9J","Redpawn3","This Carhartt Men's Knit Cuffed Beanie seems to be quality made. If you know a lot about beanies then cool. For those that don’t it feels typical for a knit. It wears comfortably with the food/roll. Except it is ONE SIZE fits ‘most’.I do have a large or bigger than ‘average’ sized head. And having read the reviews was optimistic and gave this a chance.My personal preferences are that this hat is close to what I want, but too small. It’s potentially adequate for a large head (bigger head) IF you don’t mind pulling it down constantly. Or IF you don’t mind unrolling it (leaving a single layer to cover your upper ears.)My experience- basic head turning causes the hat to slowly creepy up and expose the lower portion of ear lobes. Intense shoveling or activity makes the hat creepy up a lot faster.I feel like the hat could be maybe a centimeter or two bigger and then I’d be content.I will keep this hat, and plenty of people in the family could wear it quite comfortably, but for me and my larger/bigger sized head it falls short of contentment.This is a quality hat, but I just want to give a personal perspective on the larger head bigger head reviews. I respectfully disagree that bigger heads or larger sized heads will find this hat meets their needs.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","Smaller than desired on large, big, larger, bigger head",4,"","37","One Size","Black"
"R10JKN5868NJ7X","Drea","I want to start by saying this beanie is NOT tight like some other reviewers said. I purchased these for my kids and was weary after reading other reviews says that it fits like the youth size. I 💯 disagree with those reviews, it’s much larger and looser, it fits my normal sized head and my husbands small head. It doesn’t leave lines in my forehead and the extra material on the top of the head is not much when pulled over your ears. At $15 you can’t go wrong. Purchased 2 and will order more.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022","Best beanie!",5,"","2","One Size","Black"
"RLZGCROKH1BY6","M","As a fairly small-headed woman, this thing is awesome! I love it. I love that it’s a little big because I can fold the back down and up under my bun to keep the hair off my neck. The color is really nice, too. The material could be softer, but it’s not itchy. It’s also pretty easy to clean or peel grass/hay/straw from. I wear it all the time, it covers my ears and keeps my head warm. It’s not as toasty as my Columbia hat with the silver omni heat foil stuff (ultimate hat!), but it’s a solid farm hat. I don’t worry about getting it dirty or washing it, unlike my fancy hat. I’ll probably buy ones for my husband and children.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2022","Men’s… pifft",5,"","12","One Size","North Woods"
"RMCSIE5V8PXV3","KccaseyK","This is my 2nd purchase of this hat, however, I will tell you why at the end of my review, since this this is supposed to be a review for the item itself and not necessarily just about why I purchased the hat.This Hat would actually be a great warm winter Hat for those SD, ND, MN, WI, NY, PA, etc Type winters.As a Man, this is a great winter Hat that fits great and as expected. It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.  Also, 1 hat left at work.  The extra hats in the car or at work also serve a great purpose for helping somebody else out that may not have a hat that clearly needs one.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2015","Very comfortable and warm.

"RGXA8BJ0CXWJG","NOnononononoNoNO","Alright, since there is an incredible problem with ordering this specific item from Amazon, I will tell you what to look for when you receive your item to distinguish the deceptively convincing fakes from the authentic, legendarily *L I F E S A V I N G* Carhartt's. I live 15 minutes from the world headquarters, I know exactly how this item should function and have purchased a minimum of thirty of these over my lifetime for friends, family, and myself. You must first understand that there are three distinct factories which produce this product. The first are licensed factories in Kentucky, the second in Canada, and the third in China. The tagging of Chinese origin is not a valid reason to distinguish fake from real, as they abide by the same standard of rib stitching and acrylic quality. The second understanding is dimensional, the watch hat has an extremely specific length to width to height ratio. Finally, and most importantly, the third understanding is that the fakes from China are produced for a specific reason; they can match with convincing accuracy both the logo and the tear-able internal tag, however they cannot yet match a licensed Carhartt's quality to price ratio because of some import laws. They must sacrifice on a specific quality (the density and quality of the stitching) in order to both compete, yet remain convincing enough to still sell online.  In order to tell if your hat is truly authentic, you must verify that the brim measures 4 inches tall, the overall height 9 inches, and the brim width 8 and 1/2 inches when laid flat. Secondly, take the brim and hold it above a significant light source while stretching it between your fingers. You should feel SIGNIFICANT elastic resistance and strength in constructional constitution. - - -If light passes easily through and you can see that the internal stitching is loose like a sock, you have a fake. There is no arguing this fact, some are closer than others but none of them are as tight, dense, or BULLETPROOF as a true watch hat. If, when stretching, there is even a hint that the hat would rip if you were using it to hang off a cliff you have a F A K E. It gets cold up here in Michigan, we need these things to not die, so forgive me if I sound a little angry; I am. - - - If light BARELY passes through, with only very small pinholes of light peaking through, you have a genuine product. I have also noticed that the store ""EZ Sportswear"" consistently sells these fakes, they all say made in Canada so I suspect there is some sort of import law they can skirt and flip these bogus beanies. Seeing that it is sold by Amazon directly is not enough evidence to certify these either, I have received numerous fakes directly from Amazon. Another significant clue is that stock for these is almost always moving, there is very little dead stock on this specific item: therefore you can check Carhartt's main website and take note of which colors they offer. If you see fantastic colors only on Amazon you have another clue (this does not discredit the older heather patterns that are still available on here, I am specifically referring to colors like Peach and Winter white that looks flat white instead of the beige it should be). So there you have it, now stop arguing because I have received so many fakes from this website I won't even bother use it anymore. It's also hilariously insulting they might try to sell the women's winter white for $45 when the legitimate men's (the only size it comes in, one) is ~$14. So... watch out people, the probability is high you will be unknowingly swindled. It's really annoying planning on presents that include this hat and receiving a fake 70% of the time.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2020","HOW TO DISTINGUISH REAL FROM FAKE",1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-ZJ4f81PL.jpg

"R32JX6NNHEMHPS","BillyZ","I bought 3 different hats using 2 different sellers to see if I would get an imitation. All 3 seem to be authentic Carhartt hats. (Lucky?) I bought a ""Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat A18, Navy"" and a ""Carhartt Men's Acrylic Knit Hat, Black"" both Sold by: Amazon.com Services, Inc. I also bought a ""Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat A18, Black"" Sold by: MELISSA EPPERSON.The Carhartt emblem on all 3 hats seemed to come from the same factory, although the quality of sewing differed. The inside label showed the hats were made from 2 different North American countries: the United States and Canada. The black Watch Hat from MELISSA EPPERSON was from Canada, and its Carhartt emblem was impressively sewn (better than the picture on Amazon). The other hats emblems seemed to be sewn in a hurry.Inside the hats the black hat care label was clean and sharp. The navy hat looked like the press was running out of ink. As for the important sewing on the inside of the hat, I don't know. I make no claim to be able to judge stitching, unless it is really bad.The black hat seems to be a normal size for this type of hat, and I have been sleeping with this style of hat for over 30 years. Now the navy hat. The navy hat that I received measures about 2 inches longer than the black hat when it is laid flat. But on my head the black hat almost touches the top of my head, whereas the navy hat stands tall above my head. In the mirror the navy hat has a strong resemblance to the Matterhorn. This has been kind of fun wearing a watch/Santa hat. But not practical to sleep in.For shipping, the MELISSA EPPERSON hat was shipped the next day. The Amazon hats were shipped the day after.If any of these hats wears poorly, I will update this review.","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019","Navy Watch Hat Extra Long",5,"","2","One Size","Navy"

It felt more loose, stretchier, and not in a good way. Like the material was too giving and not as dense. I thought maybe I was just imagining it, you know, romanticizing my lost beanie.But then I found my old beanie!  I compared the two and I wasn't just imagining it. The new one is bigger, more stretched out, doesn't seem as dense, won't hold up in the long term the way my old one has. I'm so glad I got my old one back, but I wish they hadn't changed the build on these.

"R217LF6HVT34IZ","Liam Theis","I live in New England so I need a good hat from time to time. I have a bigger head so finding a hat that fits is generally an issue. It either fits and looks dumb or doesn't fit and does protect. This hat is the solution to my troubles.The hat, unlike the A205, will come right over your ears all the way. This will completely cover your ears in a double layer of fabric all around your head. The fold is adjustable so it can be as hipster beanie or tight laced as you please. The tag is easily removed if you so wish. The hat must be hand washed or it will pill and shrink like no one's business but it clearly says that on the label. Headphones will work over this hat just fine but earbuds will probably hurt as the double fabric will push them into your ears.The hat can be a little tight on the ears, maybe because I have a big head, but it should be noted. The hat retains moisture pretty easily. If you're inside or it's warmer than 45F, expect to sweat in this hat  a decent amount which will then be trapped in the hat and then make the hat smell. It takes a while to dry. I found with prolonged use that my ears felt a little sore.Pros: Warm hat for cold weather, fully covers ears with double layer, fully adjustable, works with headphones (not earbuds),Cons: Retains moisture, could put pressure on ears which can cause soreness, does not work with earbuds, takes a while to dry, not a great hat for weather above 45FI love this hat, it's wicked comfortable to wear in the cold and makes life easier.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2016","Great Hat for the price!",5,"","16","One Size","Dark Brown/Sandstone"

Like take a standard 2$ Chinese black Bennie barely secure a tag that's a new logo for some reason, at least it was on straight. I heard that fake products have been flooding amazon. I haven't looked into it enough and wouldn't know enough to go around accusing. Maybe I should have spent the money on one with a leather tag that wasn't polyester but it kept me warm and looking cool 😎. Guess I just over payed for tag which is what most people do but I kind of hate so take my negative feelings with a grain of salt. Would have paid $20 if the quality was there.

"R23133LI2O8989","Brooke Yelvington","Carhartt beanies have 2 types of people that wear them.The first is a person who probably got their undergraduate degree in art of some sorts, or enjoys coffee shops and kombucha. They normally pair the beanie with a solid colored tee, skinny black jeans and their Chelsea boots. The hat serves as a small symbol that tells another person they enjoy poetry, that their favorite band is not mainstream, they order their coffee saying venti and grande and it discreetly hides their new air pods.The second type of person is someone who is into making a living doing some manual labor. Doesn’t mind to get some dirt on their new beanies. Whether that be farming, welding, power line, or construction. The beanie doesn’t draw too much attention and it serves its purpose, a warm hat for those cold days working outside.I wore mine the first time today. I’m a college student and my day went like this. In the morning I wore black leggings, a graphic tee, adidas tennis shoes with my beanie. After lunch I changed into boots and wranglers while still keeping my beanie on for my equine lab class.

I've ordered a few of these hats over the past few years and realized recently that I had received both a knockoff Brown hat and a real Carhartt brand Navy hat. But honestly, I prefer the knockoff!The Brown imitation cap has fit like a dream since I got it. It's a pretty daily wear for me in the winter and it keeps me warm. The Navy has always been uncomfortably tight, even after a few months of trying to ""break it in."" I have an average to smaller head for a man, I'm not sure how anyone with a larger head than mine would comfortably wear one.Now, after two years, the imitation Brown is definitely feeling a bit looser. For the amount of use I've gotten, I still feel it's a great value for a $16 dollar hat. The name-brand Navy has retained it's shape much better, but to it's detriment. It was too tight at the start and continues to be too tight.If I do order another one of these hats, I'll keep my fingers crossed that I get another knockoff!","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021","Received Both a Knockoff and a Real Hat.

The message had none of that ""pulled one over on Dad"" undertone. Additionally it's a man's size so it must have gotten on my wish list from one of those Jose Cuervo moments that you hear so much about. You know, a friend of mine and dancing on the table and shooting out the lights, that sort of thing? Oh well... But in any event moving on, I am happy I bought it for her, it gives me comfort to think about her warm ears on snowy nights.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020","Thoughtful gift for my daughter I can take pride in.",5,"",1,"One Size","Bright Orange"

The tag inside the fake was a cheap paper tag, the true Carhartt hat had a silky tag. I’m not about to pay full price for a fake so I returned the brown one.

"R25S0ETSWJ22N3","TheBagramExperience","Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Dark Brown, thats the one that got away for me, folks.  It would have fit great on my mellon, kept my head and ears warm.  I would have been Made in the USA or maybe Canada.  It would have matched my Brown American Giant Classic Zip Hoodie just right.  I would have had a special place to put it next to my Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Black, Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Heather Grey, and Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Breen, which, sadly, seems to be discontinued.  Sometimes, when I would want to sleep, but it was too bright in the room or outdoors, I would have slipped it over my eyes and had a nap.  It would have been great.But I never received Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Dark Brown.  I ordered it and it was on its way, but then, suddenly, it was gone.  Cancelled.  No explanation, no Dear John letter, no warning.  Just...gone.  Now I only have it haunting me in my dreams, trapped in future-perfect tense.  A faint glimpse into a life with my Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Dark Brown that will never be.One day, Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hat in Dark Brown, we will meet again.  In this life or the next.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2016","Dreaming of what might have been.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31v0y+v0hlL.jpg","8","One Size","Dark Brown"

I have bought numerous ""beanies"" over the years only to be disappointed in quality and warmth.  So, decided to take a chance with  ""Carhartt"" beanie.  What a pleasant surprise, just WOW...................Fit is perfect, as it stays put when I am mountain biking downhill, with wind-chill a big factor.  It is also very warm.  I ordered the Black and a Yellow one.  The colors are vivid, especially the yellow one which is important when I venture on the roads for visability.

However, I won't wear it, due to it's sizing, so this is a personal opinion about style, I just don't like a beanie being folded over 3 inches and still sticking above my head for another 5 inches as you can see in the right picture.I did buy the Youth size to compare, and that's what I'm wearing in the left picture, and even that was a little long. I was worried the Youth was too tight new, but then I tried the adult size and it was just as tight. I have a bald head, but even with a full head of hair the Youth size would still be long enough.So if you like the pointless extra 5 inches of fabric sticking out then get this, if you want the more form fitting on top get the youth.","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2019","Won't wear it",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FYVdlL8SL.jpg

"R389NOFJA00OKV","PhotoKing","its a good hat. it fits, however i hate the label. it forces you to fit it doubled over which is hard to use that way. and the tag is sharp and you have to make sure it's pointed straight or you'll look like a doofus. so i took it off. i chose a bright orange hat, because i lost a brown one, and wanted to get something i had to see if it fell out again. naturally it fell out again, and ironically in brown mud. oddly the hat never dried, it was still wet when i got home hours later.the good news is, the hat washed out with just water to the point it looked new again. the bad is - why didn't the mud dry out? will moisture stay in this thing?i couldn't use it over the course of the winter, but on the days i needed some warmth, it helped. its not a super thick hat, and i have warmer, but i would wear this on a 25-35f day, though i wear another brimmed hat on this. i don't recall what it was like on a breezy day.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2015","i don't like the tag.",4,"",0,"One Size","Bright Orange"

He's had some of the Carhartt beanies for several years and still uses them.This is very warm (a double layer, I think) but not too thick. The material is soft and not scratchy at all and my husband can wear his all day if needed. It is a pretty stretchy material but no so much that it stretch and not return to its original shape. It is a good fit and is not too tight. I also love the selection of colors, these are colors that they don't always carry at the store.  Just like everything else we have bought from the Carhartt brand this is excellent quality and I fully expect these to last several years. There are no loose threads and the seams are straight and inside the hat. These are genuine Carhartt hats, which I always check with name brands on any online site. I absolutely will continue to buy these for my husband in all the colors he wants.

"R2AO7EWOL4AZLY","scooper47","When this arrived, my first thought was whether to send it back or just throw it out. I have a huge head, and this cap made it feel like it was in a vice. It was also very scratchy. I decided to force myself to wear it, I guess as punishment for ordering such a bad item. Well, after three days, it stretched out, lost its scratchiness, and I love it and wear it 24 hours a day in winter.I removed the Carhartt tag as I don't believe in free advertising. You have to be very careful and use a very sharp knife, but there is no indication it is there if done correctly. Be sure to do this before wearing it in the sun to avoid a dark spot.If I have to buy another, I will get something like a three-liter soda bottle to stretch it out before wearing it (à la Whitey Bulger, if you saw the 60 Minutes piece).Keep in mind that Amazon sells another Carhartt watch cap at the same price that is thinner and too short to be folded.

I needed to replace my old Watch Hat that I lost recently, and this hat was a last-minute purchase before I traveled to upstate New York last weekend where it was cold and snowing. The hat is basic, but  Carhartt does basic well. This and my Schott Bothers pea coat are going to be my cold-weather uniform for the foreseeable future. Like the coat, this hat is made in the USA. That is almost as important to me as the article of clothing doing its job well.The only other thing I will write is that I have not had the hat long, so I do not know how it will stand up over time (washings, rain, snow, etc.), and I have not been out with it on a particularly wet night. Pure wool is scratchy and uncomfortable, but it can still provide warmth when soaked. I will have to see if the acrylic version holds up the same way.

"RR0Z87J8OIE7R","RobertGonzalez","In the way of a stocking cap, or beanie, the Carhartt variety is a very good choice. It is inexpensive but very well built, holds its shape and doesn't fall apart like a lot of cheap beanies. I currently own four of these (Black, Light Brown, Dark Brown and Heather Gray) and all of them keep their color, their shape and their warmth without issue. And for $10, these are about as good a deal as you will find for a high quality stocking cap.For those of you that are bald, or that shave your head, keep one thing in mind... when your head is all smooth from a fresh shave, this cap will have a slightly difficult time staying on your dome. It will do it, but it will work for it. However, all of the other beanies I've had don't even come close to staying on my squeaky clean scalp after a fresh shave, so this is another reason I love this beanie as much as I do.","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2017","Keeps my big fat bald head warm all the time",5,"",1,"One Size","Coal Heather"

"R3J8Z7TMVWQDXF","Jay M","Bought this for my vehicle after leaving work one day when the temperature had dropped almost 20 degrees and I had left home without a hat. I was cold. So I bought this watch cap, figuring it would be warm (Carhartt), planning on keeping it in my vehicle until needed.  I bought bright orange for safety reasons, since it will be full time in the vehicle and you never know, and it is definitely a 'safety orange' color (although not reflective, not that I expected that).  It's also huge.  I wear a 7 3/8 hat (if I remember right, it's been a while) and this hat, is huge. It does fit, as far as staying on my head and covering me up and so on.  It's hardly going to make me a fashion statement, but I don't think anybody in this town would think of me for that anyways, so I am happy with this purchase.  Mrs. M adds that a ponytail fits nicely in the extra part on top.

"RZTWDEX9X4T9J","cbel","I purchased the grey beanie 3 years ago in 2017 from this exact same listing. The beanie is great, I wore it pretty much every day throughout the winter and it has held up really well. It is starting to pill and look a little worn out, so I decided to purchase a new beanie in black. As you can see from the attached picture, the black beanie is much thinner and longer than the grey beanie. It looks ridiculous no matter how I try and fold it.Giving 3 stars because the grey beanie is great in terms of comfort and durability. I can't recommend purchasing this hat through this Amazon listing though because it seems like it's a gamble as to which size you'll end up with. The tags say the grey one was made in the USA and the black one was made in Canada, perhaps that accounts for the difference in size.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020","Buyer beware - inconsistent sizes between colors",3,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716nKXMDMuL.jpg

It's a nice weight, fits my big head well, and is warm and comfortable.The quality is great, as you'd expect from Carhartt.

So I ordered this beanie cause I wanted one just like it but in a different color. They are both made of the same material but made in different countries... His beanie is made in China where as this one is made in Canada. This beanie is an average ""meh"" in softness kind of beanie. So today I went to the store in town to get a different beanie and it seems that all the colors are made in different countries and have varying degrees of softness.  It could also have to do with the dye that the acrylic is colored with.

"R1M0RONMPYKPFL","Clueless in Seattle","I've had a couple of Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hats A18, Brite Lime  for a number of years, and when I lost one, I ordered a couple more from amazon to keep on hand as spares.Well the other day my usual hat hadn't  fully dried after laundering, so I opened the package of one of my spare hats, and was deeply disappointed.  The fabric of the new hat is completely different from my old hat.  It stretches way too much and doesn't keep its shape.  The weave  of the old had is thicker and more substantial; has more heft.  The new hat feels flimsy and cheesy.These new hats are unwearable.  So I checked the label and found that the old hat was made in Canada whereas the new hats were made in China.What am I to do with these unusable hats?  I'm sure they are not  returnable to amazon, because so much time has passed since I ordered them.  I wondered if Carhartt would take them back, so I went to their ""Contact Us"" page and filled out a form.  But when I clicked ""Submit"" there was a really long pause and then an error message:""Gateway Timeout""""The proxy server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.""""Reference #1.7d5c217.1623374196.7a5b26f ""So now,  where am I going to find a hat comparable to my only remaining genuine Carhartt hat?","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","Made in China, not in Canada like my old one",1,"","4","One Size","Brite Lime"

For those of you worried that this beanie will be too small, you can rest assured that this will probably fit. I wear a size 7 5/8 baseball cap, and normally have a difficult time fitting into headwear that's ""one size fits all,"" but this beanie fits great.I'm not usually one to openly advertise brand tags on my clothing, especially right in the middle of my head, but the Carhartt logo seems so natural looking on these beanies.

I have a fairly average head, and yet my head felt somewhat squeezed by it for a good couple hours, then it was fine. So, don't be surprised as you may have to break it in just like a shoe. I wore it hiking in ~14 degree windy weather and learning to snowboard in ~30 degree calm weather this past winter, and I got far too hot trying to snowboard, yet was fine hiking. So I'd say it's more for really cold/ windy days, and on those days you'll be glad you have this hat.BOTTOM LINE: Buy this hat if you live in/ go to cold areas.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2015","Great hat for the price.",4,"","2","One Size","Black"

The temperatures dipped down below 0, and all I had was a wally world purchased hat with a big hole in it. Fine for normal weather, but add sub zero wind, and it froze my brain.In January 2014, temperatures once again dipped below 0, but this time I had my Carhartt watch hat. Head and ears stayed warm, despite the wind and temperatures. Face and neck were cold, but tolerable because of the hat.Highly recommended!Update 1/1/2018: Four years later and a dozen or more washings, this hat is still in PERFECT condition.

"R2U5PEE24DHOME","Etude","The most comfortable, snug, warm winter hat I'll ever need, and it all comes in the form of Carhartt's acrylic hat. The instant I put it on, my head felt completely safe from any elements that mother nature could throw at me-- and considering I'd just shaved my head days before, that's saying something.Unfortunately the fine people at Carhartt decided to put their ugly, goofy logo RIGHT in the middle of the hat, making you look like a billboard for the company as much as a satisfied customer. Still, a small price to pay for comfort and warmth during these winter months. Literally a small price to pay, as this was one of the cheapest choices on Amazon and I STILL love the quality and feel.In conclusion, I can already tell this snug, well crafted, cozy, form fitting hat will serve my cranial needs for many days.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2012","Stupid name, great hat.",5,"",1,"One Size","Dark Brown"

"R3E45E0FU5OH2K","Luke T. Strecker","I bought a Carhart hat just like this one in a Kroger store three weeks ago. Soft cloth, plenty of room for the head; I can wear it all day no problem. Even get hot in it and it doesn’t make my head itchy or anything. Wanted a black one also, so I got it from Amazon. I’m not sure what the deal is, but the black one is made from a much coarser linen. I don’t have super sensitive skin, and it made my head noticeably irritated where it had direct skin contact by just wearing it. If I worked up some heat by moving around it felt even more uncomfortable.So here’s a heads up that this product sold here may have the Carhart name on it, but it’s definitely not the same quality as what you find in the sporting goods section of your local store. Buying in the store was only $12. Two dollars more than Amazon prices.

Still, one of the two ordered from Amazon had a hole in the top seam (w/unraveling) and the 2nd looks as if it will unravel any day now. The product itself, as w/most Carhartt items, is ordinarily a top-shelf item (why I was gracious w/3 Stars). These two caps however, should have never been shipped to a customer (quality control lacking). I gave them to some younger family members; as they will likely tear them up anyway.

It is warm, comfortable and understated, while also being only $10. If I lose this hat I will just turn around and buy another one, no questions asked.

I ordered a second just to be sure, and it also was made in China. The Carhartt website and the product information here on Amazon both say this color should be made in the US, so I'm not sure if it's a fake or that something changed and no one has changed their product information. I specifically was looking for made in USA products, so these are going back, sadly. I also ordered the black, and it says 'Made in Canada of Imported Parts,' which is also frustrating because the product information here also says black should be made in the US. I am getting pretty sick of incorrect product information on Amazon in general lately, and it has definitely scaled back my online shopping substantially.

"R2SETUB1DKMTNC","Joseph","I was excited for an upgrade in color from my previous Carhartt had which I have worn regularly for several years. I clipped the tags as soon as I received it but, unfortunately, I did not try it on first. When I did put the cap on, I realized that it was extremely tight fitting. After ~15 minutes of wear, my head still felt like it was in a vice. I double-checked my order to be sure that I didn't order a child's or women's sized product. It is listed a ""Men's"" one-size. I have no doubt in the genuineness of the produce and have typically loved the fit and warmth of Carhartt products.

I can easily pull the hat over my eyes with it rolled without stretching the fabric and I have a larger than usual head.  This isn't really an issue unless you are looking for a skullcap look.

I usually read reviews but didn't think I needed to for a simple Carhartt beanie. So be aware!!First photo is comparing logos. Obviously not the same.Middle photo is comparing tags inside the fake beanie compared to the real.

These kinds of hats go by many names depending on what part of the country you come from: winter hat, stocking cap, toboggan, watch cap, sock hat, knit cap, etc.  However, no matter where you're from, this hat will fit great, and keep your head nice and warm.  Its also made in the USA, and I'm all about that.

"R343PFK3APBZBL","edfan","I've liked Carhartt products a long time. Their coveralls let me change oil lying on a cold garage floor, their clothing generally is good quality at a premium but fair price. In this case, I'm disappointed. This cap will help keep you warm if it stays on - but it's ""slippery"" and doesn't fit a 7-1/4 hat size. It leaves a large empty space at the top even when you pull it down but the worst thing is that it slips constantly, slowly pulling up toward the crown until you're afraid to lean over for fear the hat will fall off. It might do for a child or a person with a small head. It doesn't stay on otherwise. It's quite cheap and the workmanship is fine. If your head is small enough, it might hold. Otherwise, you'll be constantly pulling at it to stay covered.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2013","Decent quality, poor fit",3,"",0,"One Size","Bright Orange"

That is the least of the differences. The warmth you get from the real one is INSANE compared to this fake one (which barely keeps your head warm.) The worst part is the prices are the same so you are better off going to the actual Carthart website and ordering it from there. It was free shipping for me as well, so it is a no brainer. Luckily, returning through amazon is extremely easy. But now I know to stick with the real websites.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2021","not authentic !!",1,"",0,"One Size","Black"

"R3FDSLWCR6DXZU","Native Son","I have no idea how this watch cap can be so different from the other Carhartt hat I have.  The other one I own fits snugly and is about 10.5"" when laid flat, so that when you put it on and flip the brim back over (depending on your head size) you'll have 2-3"" of doubled material.I expected the same from this hat and was extremely disappointed.  First, it is very loose and sort of hangs on your head.  Second, when laid flat, it is 14"" long and looks more like a sock than a hat.  When I placed it on my head so that it completely covered my ears and flipped the material back, the brim was literally at the top of my head.  It looked and felt ridiculous.
